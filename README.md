## Description of Miss Mango's Class

Miss Mango's Class is a website meant to make learning more fun for students through different learning. While the website is still up for furthur expansion, this is the current premise. 
There are two games: Flashcard Frenzy! and Mango Beat! Flashcard Frenzy is your typical flashcards, meant for visual learners who prefer seeing what they're working with. Mango Beat! is a game meant for tactile and auditory learners. The game works by taking in text and converting it into music and a beat map which will then be playable by the student through a rhythm game.
